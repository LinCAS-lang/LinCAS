# LinCAS-lang
## The Linmeric programming language
LinCAS is a dinamically typed and interpreted programming languages which aim is to unify two projects: Linmeric command-line calculator
and FFCas, a very simple representation of a symbolic function.

## Why?
The idea is to unify a general purpose language with a computer algebra system, in order to obtain a powerful tool to solve mathematic, engeneering, physical
and other sort of problems.

## Status
The project is in pre-alpha stage, it is usable, even though the documentation is being edited, but the core and the API are still under development as well.

Some sintax or some other element might change to best fit the usability, until the language will reach the alpha stage. Then only improvements or API development
will be made.

## To do:
  * [ ] Unit Test library
  * [ ] Improving parsing. Maybe using a Bison-generated one
  * [ ] Compile time optimizations
  * [ ] Speeding up the VM
  * [ ] Inline caches
  * [ ] Integer optimization (avoiding object allocation for ints)
  * [ ] String API optimization
  * [ ] String interpolation
  * [ ] BigInt conversion from string
  * [ ] adding other useful scientific API
  
## Contributing
Any help or idea is welcome. The project is ambitious and reuires a lot of work. Whoever wants to contribure can open a branch, make some changes and then pull a request.
